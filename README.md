### Adding New Software and Tools

If you want to contribute by adding new software or tools to the setup scripts, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/setupmymac.git
   cd setupmymac
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes.
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feat/add-new-tool
   ```

4. **Modify the Setup Script**:
   - Open the appropriate setup script in the `scripts/` directory (e.g., `frontend-setup.sh`, `backend-setup.sh`, `data-analysis-setup.sh`, or `custom-setup.sh`).
   - Add the new tool to the `tool_names` array.
   - Ensure the tool is also added to the `selected_tools` array if you want it to be selected by default.

5. **Update the Helper Script**:
   - Open `utils/helper.sh`.
   - Add a new case in the `install_tools()` function to handle the installation of the new tool. Use `brew install` or other appropriate commands.
   - If necessary, add any post-installation steps in the `post_install_setup()` function.

6. **Test Your Changes**: Run the modified script to ensure the new tool installs correctly and without errors.

7. **Commit Your Changes**: Follow the Conventional Commits specification for your commit message.
   ```sh
   # For adding a new tool
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add [Tool Name] to setup scripts"

   # For fixing a tool installation
   git commit -m "fix: correct [Tool Name] installation process"

   # For updating documentation
   git commit -m "docs: update [Tool Name] installation instructions"

   # For improving existing functionality
   git commit -m "refactor: optimize [Tool Name] installation"
   ```
